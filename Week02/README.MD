In this code, I use numpy, pandas, scipy, ARIMA from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model, plot_acf, plot_pacf from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots, and matplotlib.pylot.

I have not changed the name of the csv files. I use pd.read_csv() to read these csv files, which should function as long as the csv files are under the same location as the .py file.
